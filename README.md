2. What i'm woking on and what I've done?

I've been hard at work on the project and have made significant progress on the front end development. I've been putting in a lot of effort to make sure that the user experience is top-notch and have a little bit left to finish it fully.

Moving forward, the next half of the work will be focused on developing the back end using Spring. This is an exciting challenge as it will require me to integrate a variety of technologies and tools to make the project fully functional.

To ensure the project is fully operational, I will need to create a robust and scalable infrastructure for data storage and processing. I will also be implementing various security measures to ensure that sensitive information is protected. Additionally, I will be creating a comprehensive set of API endpoints to enable seamless communication between the front end and back end.

Overall, I am confident that my skills and experience will allow me to successfully complete the project and deliver a high-quality product that meets all the requirements. I am eager to continue working on this project and see it come to fruition.

In addition to my existing skills and experience, I am also constantly learning new things and incorporating them into my work on this project. Whether it's a new programming language, a new framework, or a new development tool, I am always seeking out new ways to improve my skills and bring new and innovative ideas to the table.

By incorporating these new technologies and techniques, I am able to deliver even better results and create projects that stand out from the rest. My goal is to always stay ahead of the curve and bring the best possible solution.

In conclusion, I am dedicated to constantly learning and growing as a developer, and this project is no exception. I am confident that my efforts to stay up-to-date and continuously improve will result in a fantastic final product that exceeds all expectations.
